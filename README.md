P1) When we open the console in the website given, we realize that there is a bunch of different classes.
The main classes that we can recognice is the "title" wich give us the title of the news, and has an url attached that redirect us
to the news site; Then there is the class "spacer" wich includes the space between the titles of the articules and finally the class "athing" wich includes all past classes.
It also has a Valign called "top" wich includes the vote button. 
In conclussion, this HTML structure its like a "big box" with a bunch of "little boxes" inside.

of the design of the website, such as the colours, the type of letter, the distribution of the text in the website, etc.
